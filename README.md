# Wp Remindme + sendy

I'm trying to make a plugin to send a visitor the article by email, and add them to sendy in the process.

Note that I'm making this plugin for myself and am initially hard coding parameters into it like my email address ans email signature.

I might make an admin interface with it later.

# Usage

Make sure to set the variables in the PHP class (API stuff and urls).

I make use of a custom field in sendy called 'Remindme' where the post title is stored. Make sure it actually exists :)
